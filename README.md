# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Predict fraud, minimizing the amount of false positives

## Problem:
1 in 5 transactions declared as fraud are truly fraud. $9 billion is the cost of real fraud in a year.However, $118 billion is the cost of blocked sales in a year

## Goal: 
Predict fraud, minimizing the amount of false positives. Explore the role of autoencoders in fraud detection

## Dataset:
Kaggle credit card dataset[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
Contains 28 masked features + Time + Amount. 284,807 transactions, 492 frauds (0.17%): Imbalanced 
Splitting: 200,000 training, 50,000 for validation, 34,807 for test

## Final Models Summary:

## Other Models Summary:

## Conclusion:
As seen from above the cost for final models  is minimized about 6 to 78 times compared to other  models by minimizing the False Positives.Therefore in fraud detection , taking care of the false positives is as important as taking care of the frauds.
